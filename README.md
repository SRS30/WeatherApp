# WeatherApp
A simple web app that allows users to enter a location and get the current weather information for that place using OpenWeatherMap API.

API Key (IMPORTANT):
This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. To make it work, you need to replace the apiKey variable in the script.js file with your OpenWeatherMap API key. Be sure to keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.

// Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your OpenWeatherMap API key
const apiKey = 'your_actual_api_key_here';
